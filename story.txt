	Bill sat quietly sipping coffee. He sat in a corner booth of a small
diner called Tom's, waiting. As to what he was waiting for, Bill didn't have
the faintest of ideas. He only knew that he was supposed to meet a man called
Bones, though he knew that wasn't his real name. Looking to scrape together
some extra cash to help pay off his mom's medical expenses, a friend pointed
him in the direction of this man who calls himself Bones. Their conversation
was short and sweet. "Meet me at Tom's Diner friday at 6pm. I think it's in
your best interest that you show up. Oh, and come alone" Bones told him. So
Bill sat in his corner booth, nervously sipping coffee. He checked his watch 
and saw it was 10 till 6. 

Bill sat quietly waiting. He waited 10 more minutes until 6, but Bones was
nowhere to be seen. He waited another half an hour until he decided to leave.
Bill walked out to his car, opened the door, got in, and turned his key.
"Don't turn around, Bill," said a voice from behind him, "let's try to act
discrete."
"How did you get in here?" asked Bill, flustered.
"It doesn't matter how I got in here, it just matters that I'm here. Do you
want the job or not?"
"Of course I want it, Bones, what do I need to do?"
"Ok, Bill, this one will be tough, I need you to steal the octo parakeet"
